# Description
An electricity billing system using Java Swing is a software application that automates the billing process of an electricity company. The application is developed using Java programming language and its graphical user interface (GUI) is created using Swing, which is a set of GUI components for Java.

The system allows the electricity company to keep track of customer accounts, meter readings, and generate bills automatically. The application allows the company to enter customer details, including name, address, meter number, and billing cycle. The system then stores this information in a database for future reference.

When a customer's meter reading is taken, the system updates the database and calculates the electricity usage for the billing cycle. The system then generates a bill for the customer, including the amount due, due date, and any other relevant information. The bill is printed or emailed to the customer.

The system also includes features such as payment tracking, late payment reminders, and penalty calculations. The payment tracking feature allows the company to keep track of payments made by customers and mark them as paid in the system. The late payment reminder feature sends notifications to customers who have not paid their bills by the due date. The penalty calculation feature calculates any penalties or late fees that may be charged to customers who do not pay on time.

Overall, the electricity billing system using Java Swing provides an efficient and accurate way for electricity companies to manage their billing process, reduce errors, and improve customer service.
